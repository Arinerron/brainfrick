# About `brainfrick`

## what is this

i dont know tbh

## well, why did you make it?

coronavirus

## ok, relatable, but why rust

i felt like writing crappy code so i picked a language i didn't know to force myself to write crappy code

## what inspired this project specifically

a friendly crab on discord named ferris made a cool symbolic execution library for brainheck. this seemed like a good starting place for rust.

## why did you call it `brainfrick` instead of `brainheck`

cuz i added a new feature. it's a for loop implemented using `{}` in the same way `[]` is implemented.

basically, it marks the current cell as the iterator cell, executes `>`, then executes the code in the loop. once it repeats, it checks if the iterator cell is `0`. if it is, it continues past the loop. otherwise, it executes the loop again.

actually it's broken rn so don't try it lol

## does this code work

yeah

## why does this code work

i frequently ask myself that

## ???
